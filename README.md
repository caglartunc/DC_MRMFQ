# Dual-Connectivity Activation Analysis in Cellular Networks using Multi-Regime Markov Fluid Queues (MRMFQs)

A mmWave vehicular network in a highway scenario is simulated. mmWave-enabled vehicles communicate with the roadside units (RSUs) either over direct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, or through other mmWave-enable vehicles that act as relays.

## Running the code:

First, run 'gen_config.m' to generate configuration files, and 'define_matrices.m' to create infinitesmall generator and drift matrices. Then, run 'main_test'.
Plotting and data generation scripts are also provided under names 'plot_data.m' and 'gen_save_data.m', respectively.
Search space for activation/deactivation thresholds, used for numerical optimization, can be generated by running 'search_thresholds.m'.
