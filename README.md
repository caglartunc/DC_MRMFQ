# Dual-Connectivity Activation Analysis in Cellular Networks using Multi-Regime Markov Fluid Queues (MRMFQs)

A dual-connectivity scenario analyzer with a Master Cell Group (MCG) and a Secondary Cell Group (SCG). Each cell group has low-band, mid-band and high-band carriers, whose rates are modeled through separate Markov chains. Four boundaries of the MRMFQ model, at 0, Td (SCG deactivation threshold), Ta (SCG activation threshold), and B (PDCP buffer size), constitute three regimes.

## Running the code:

First, run 'gen_config.m' to generate configuration files, and 'define_matrices.m' to create infinitesmall generator and drift matrices. Then, run 'main_test'.
Plotting and data generation scripts are also provided under names 'plot_data.m' and 'gen_save_data.m', respectively.
Search space for activation/deactivation thresholds, used for numerical optimization, can be generated by running 'search_thresholds.m'.
